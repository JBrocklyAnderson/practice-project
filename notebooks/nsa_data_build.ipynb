    "# Building the Nation-State Attack Dataset\n",
    "This notebook is dedicated to aggregating all of the nation-state attack (NSA) data sent via email and merging it with the second NSA data that was tested for normality and validated for correlation in `nsa_corr_validation`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first set of nation-state data is built from a dictionary of key-value pairs with the name of the attack, it's group and state attribution, the year it started, the year it ended, and the ID and description of the CVE exploited. Some of these values are actually lists of values that describe more complex relationships between attacks and their properties. It was important to capture this information and intuitive to organize it as such, but it presents a problem commonly besetting more complex datasets that will be addressed after exploding these lists across multiple rows.\n",

Since there is a one-to-one relationship between `cve_id` and their `description`, we'll explode these columns simultaneously. Only then will we explode the lists in the `attribution_state` column, since we don't want to create false relationships that suggest that, within the context of a single attack, Nation $A$ used CVE $A$ while Nation $B$ used CVE $B$, when in fact we don't know. Ultimately, we have to represent the situation as both nations having used both CVEs. I created the dictionary object knowing how Pandas needs our observation's lists aligned, so we can avoid we what had to do for the CVE and CWE lists in terms of normalizing their content lengths."

    "## Aggregating Duplicates\n",
    "Here, we tackle a challenge commonly encountered when working with complex datasets: handling duplicate values. Initially, our dataset contained multiple values for certain fields within the same row. To manage this, we \"exploded\" or \"unnested\" these lists into multiple rows, ensuring that each value appeared in its own row. However, this step introduced a new issue—merging this dataset with others would likely produce **Cartesian products** (unwanted duplication of data) and misalignment across rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "While simply deleting the duplicate rows might seem like a solution, it would result in the loss of valuable information. For instance:\n",
    "- A specific CVE (like CVE-2020-5902) might have been exploited by two countries in the same attack.\n",
    "- Another CVE (like CVE-2017-0144) might have been used by different countries in separate attacks.\n",
    "- Though other attacks lack A CVE altogether, they still represent important attacks that we may fill with a CVE once we find them.\n",
    "This type of detail is crucial for our analysis and should be preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we use a process called aggregation. Instead of removing duplicates, we group the rows by their cve_id and aggregate the values of the other columns into lists. This approach allows us to retain all relevant information while ensuring that our dataset remains clean and organized, ready for further merging or analysis. By combining multiple rows into one, we avoid the risk of data misalignment during future merges and ensure that the relationships between cve_ids and their associated data (such as countries involved or attack details) remain intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method helps us maintain a balance: we retain the richness of the data without sacrificing the structural integrity of our dataset."

After checking the duplicates that exist, we see that certain CVEs were targeted in multiple attacks by different groups belonging to different nation-states.
